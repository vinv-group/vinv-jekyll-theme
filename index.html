    <p>
        This standardization enables data to be captured and processed from one data source (<span class=\"heighlight\">.vinv</span> file or compatible databases) - regardless of the technical equipment or financial capabilities of the users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the standardized form, this uniform data basis can be used in various applications such as <span class=\"heighlight\">visualizations</span>, <span class=\"heighlight\">scientific analyses</span> or <span class=\"heighlight\">forest management</span>.

        The standardization specifications (developed by the <a href=\"/group\">vinv group</a>) defines the syntax and semantics of forest inventory data.

        This inventory data can be created from regular field data, the result of processed laser scannings or machine learning predictions and simulations.
